# Workshop

Your sister, Mamey, and her quirky friend, Cherry are nuts ü•ú about home made
ice-cream üç®. So diehard, in fact, that they even tend to a dairy cow and grow
sugar cane in their greenhouse, _just_ to make the creamiest and most natural
ice-cream.

You're lucky, because you get great ice-cream, but unfortunately, she's got a
grueling day job as an engineering manager for a big tech company and doesn't
have time to do what she really loves -- making ice-cream. Cherry is also
üíØ day dreaming about quitting her product management job to start an ice-cream
business in their, hip-to-death, town of Asheville, NC.

Oh also, you have this other friend Chip, who's a drone geek and has been
fine-tuning his drone delivery system for jars of jam, something that could
easily be translated to a drone based ice-cream delivery system!

You _have_ been itching to hack on a side project and this feels too good to
pass up.

You've been listening to some [Indie Hackers
episodes](https://share.transistor.fm/s/f4184c5a) recently and are feeling
super motivated to take the plunge and ditch your own golden-handcuffs.

From that episode, you learned that Sam helped build a üç™ cookie empire to
$200k/month in revenue üí∞. They decided to keep things very lean and rather than
paying for an ecomm platform, that they'd build their own.


**Several benefits**:

0. Avoid paying e-comm platform fees
0. Make a very customizable payment flows where customers can select flavors
0. Flexibility to build specialized admin tools


The weather ‚òÄÔ∏è  last weekend was incredible. Sunday afternoon was your nephew's
birthday. He turned 10, got hella Legos, and ate way too much ice-cream. As the
heat started to fade and the sun began to sink, you're sipping some White Claws
and chatting with your sister, Chip and Cherry. "He's so old! Before he knows it,
he'll be an adult with a job he hates!" Cherry says.

"Hogwash! It doesn't need to be that way. Listen to this Indie Hackers
episode!" I rebutted. "Okay Google... play Indie Hackers Throwback with Sam
Eaton." Google home loaded the audio file and started to play with a nice intro
"playing Indie Hackers on Spotify..."

40 minutes later, we're on the patio, covered in dry erase marker and plans for
starting an ice-cream business drawn all over the sliding glass door. Our
make-shift dry erase board spelled out a beautiful plan, but between the
wireframe lines, anyone could clearly see only one thing -- we all needed to
quit our jobs and go all-in on this idea, lest we shrivel into our shells of
OKRs and Perf cycles.


You all go home, each with a list of verbal action items. You just can't shake it, tho.
The drive home, then in the shower, then while lying awake in bed. The list of
TODOs and the CouldDos is growing, so you open your crusty personal laptop, the
one you don't use much now that you're on the work machine all day, and you
open a [markdown file](./TODO.md).
