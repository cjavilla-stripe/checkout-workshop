Your sister and her quirky friend, Cherry are nuts 🥜 about home made ice-cream
🍨. So diehard in fact, they even tend to a dairy cow and grow sugar cane in
their greenhouse, _just_ to make the creamiest and most natural ice-cream.

You're lucky, because you get great ice-cream, but unfortunately, she's got a
grueling day job as an engineering manager for a big tech company and doesn't
have time to do what she really loves -- making ice-cream. Cherry is also
💯 day dreaming about quitting her product management job to start an ice-cream
truck in their, hip-to-death, town of Asheville, NC.

You've been listening to some [Indie Hackers
episodes](https://share.transistor.fm/s/f4184c5a) recently and are feeling
super motivated to take the plunge and ditch your own golden-handcuffs.
