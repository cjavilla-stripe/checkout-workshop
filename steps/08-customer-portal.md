# 08 Customer portal

[If you give a mouse 🐁 a cookie
🍪](https://www.amazon.com/You-Give-Mouse-Cookie-Book/dp/0060245867) they'll
want a glass of milk 🥛 -- thankfully you've got a few dairy cows around for
that now. If you give customer's subscriptions, they'll want a way to change
their plan, cancel, update payment methods, and pause their subscription during
those cold winter months when ice-cream isn't a high priority.

Lots of dev influencers talk on Twitter about how much code they were able to
delete when they [integrated the Customer
portal](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal).
It seems like that's the easiest way to solve the short term needs of the
customer.

### Actions

Integrate the customer portal so that customers can manage their subscriptions.
At the end of this section, customers should be able to change their payment
method on file and cancel on their own.

🧠 Can customers use the portal to select different flavors? Different quantities?

🧠 What are the gaps in the customer portal, if any?
