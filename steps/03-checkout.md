# 03 Checkout

You, Mamey, and Cherry are starting to have some tough conversations about the
future of the business. Their UXR shows that if we don't ship flavor selection
_this week_ then the business is [default dead](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html).


## Actions

Create a Checkout Session with the flavors and quantities and redirect to
Checkout.

ðŸ§  Can the session be created client-side? server-side?

ðŸ§  Can redirection be done client-side? server-side?


Once you're able to redirect:

- [ ] enable shipping address collection, so you know where to deliver
- [ ] improve your Checkout branding settings (how round or sharp can you make those corners?)
- [ ] enable tax collection


You, Mamey, and Cherry are on a rocket ship ðŸš€. All of the lines are up and to
the right ðŸ“ˆ.
