# 00 Add products

At this point, you've experimented with Payment Links and know they are a great
option for selling a single flavor. But your sister is bummed that she can't
unleash her creative inner child and start selling more flavors like Chocolate
Hazelnut üç´, funfetti üåà, and Tiramisu üç•!

You know that you need to create some products in Stripe, but rather than creating
each by hand, you'll want to make this a little faster.

If you haven't already, [install the Stripe
CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli). We'll use that to quickly [create
Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products/create) and
[Prices](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/create).

Due to popular demand, here's a short list of flavors she wants to add:

```
amaretto-almond
chery
chocolate-hazelnut
cookies-and-cream
espresso-coffee
funfetti-cake
salted-caramel
tiramisu
```

### Actions

Using products and prices, model several flavors for your inventory. For now,
you only sell by the pint. Customers should see a name, description, image,
currency, amount and tax ID.

You decide whether you want each flavor to be the same price or if you want to
charge more for those delicious chunks of cookie, or swirls of caramel. To keep
it easy, assume you'll only sell in one currency, to start.

üß† Should you have one Product for the pint of ice-cream, then several prices for
each flavor? One Product for each price point? One Product with one Price per
price point? One Product per flavor each with one price for USD? Why?




**Hints**:

The tax ID for Food is: `txcd_40040000`. In case you're curious, you can look
that up here: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/tax-codes.


You'll find some `.jpeg` product images for each in the
[`assets/images`](../assets/images) directory.
