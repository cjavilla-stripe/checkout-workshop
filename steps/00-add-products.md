# 00 Add products

At this point, you've experimented with Payment Links and know they are a great
option for selling a single flavor. But your sister is bummed that she can't
get creative and start selling more flavors like Chocolate Hazelnut 🍫 and
Tiramisu 🍥!

You know that you need to create some products in Stripe, but rather than creating
each by hand, you'll want to make this a little faster.

If you haven't already, [install the Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli),
then use the CLI to quickly create Products and Prices for each of the flavors:

```
amaretto-almond
chery
chocolate-hazelnut
cookies-and-cream
espresso-coffee
funfetti-cake
salted-caramel
tiramisu
vanilla
```

You'll find some `.jpeg` product images for each in the [`assets/images`](../assets/images) directory.


A public URL for each file looks like:
