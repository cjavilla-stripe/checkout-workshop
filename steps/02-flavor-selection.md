# 02 Flavor selection

When starting out in beta, you didn't even have a website, so we kept it simple
and used PaymentLinks. It's killing Cherry and my sister that customer's can't
pick more flavors, tho.

There's a jira ticket sitting in my inbox to add "flavor selection" to the site.

(Who am I kidding, we can't afford jira yet, it's just a text from my
sister, but damn it feels like a jira ticket.)


Customers love to identify with a specific flavor of ice-cream. They want
variety, but to start, you'll need to keep things simple so that you can refine
the process.

Build a tool to collect the üç® flavor preferences from customers. For now, keep it
simple.
