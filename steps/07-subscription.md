# 07 Subscription

Business is going so well that Chip and Cherry are on a fieldtrip today with a
commercial realestate agent. They are looking for new warehouse space with a
massive industrial kitchen.

Ideally, a little closer to a bigger city, but far enough from major Airports
that Chip can still use his cottage drone delivery license from the FAA to make
lots of quick local ice-cream drops.

I was chatting with a regular, Lemon
the other day and had an idea. Lemon hosts a dinner party once per month and
she always provides several flavors for her guests. She asked if we would just
automatically charge her each month for 2 of each flavor and send her a box.

I started thinking about how we might automate this, but to start, I just created
a google calendar event "Make JoAnne's order (2xflavor)" that repeated each month.

This was a pain tho, because each month, I had to go into the Stripe Dashboard,
create a new custom charge, and that didn't track all of the same line items for the
flavors. It was really throwing off our reporting.

### Actions

ðŸ§  How should you model products and prices?
