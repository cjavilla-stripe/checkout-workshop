# 09 Connect marketplace

Fast forward 2 years. Business is crushing it. You have 9 locations and have a
playbook for setting up new nano-farms and cranking out ice-cream. You've
launched new flavors iterated on past flavors, and even sponsor a Sumo Wrestler
named Karen and an E-sports athlete named Evelyn.

Investors are starting to slide into Mamey and Cherry's DMs with cold offers
for funding. You've reached 43% profit margins by keeping the operation
incredibly efficient, hiring drone pilots from the e-sports league and even
some with military training.

At the same time, your cousin from Portland has been getting curious about your
operation. They took notes and have a small ice-cream operation of their own,
but lack the software to get to the next level.

You've heard in the past "you can't skip a rock without hitting a Connect
opportunity," and you know that Connect is roughly about building marketplaces
to facilitate payments for others.

Could Connect be the answer here? Is it possible to extend your application
to be rebranded as another local ice-cream shop?

### Actions

Use the Stripe dashboard to create a `standard` connect account for your cousin.

Then update the code so that it will create direct charges for that account. For now,
simply hard code the new account's ID so that you can test out the flows and see
where the money lands.

ðŸ§  Why standard type accounts? Could we do the same with Express? Why would se
choose Standard over Express or even Custom?

ðŸ§  Why direct instead of destination charges?
